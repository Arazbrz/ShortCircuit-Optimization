Folders: 

- Anything in Functions Folder need be imoprted to Main.m - 
- Unused folder is unused for now -
- Test Cases Folder include different test cases, currently we only have the 6 bus model -
- Only the MPC XX .mat file from "Test Cases" is loaded in Main.m -
- XX.m file in "Test Cases is used to make and modify corresponding XX.mat test case" -
- In Main.m first Functions are imported, then Case is imported then Fault is added to the case (choose the faulty bus in the corresponding function) -
- More info on Yalmip: https://yalmip.github.io/tutorial/basics/-
- MPC is the variable for the whole test case -
